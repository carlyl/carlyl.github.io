<p>I became a social worker hoping to master the art of direct practice but reality sent me in a different direction.</p><p>I built my first database as an undergraduate intern in 2008 before spending five years developing custom systems tracking program information, eligibility criteria, intake applications, waiting lists, financial assistance, green energy improvements and more.</p>
<p>I received a macro social work opportunity of a lifetime in 2012, creating a new common sense <a href="http://openeligibility.org" alt="openeligibility.org" target=”_blank”> taxonomy of social services</a> to help simplify the process of searching for information about human services. Researching tens of thousands of community service programs delivered across federal and state agencies, nonprofits, churches, public schools, hospitals, utility companies and more proved to be my greatest and most rewarding professional challenge to date.</p>

<p>Today, I live in Austin, Texas where I help community service professionals manage and utilize data. I advocate for smarter technology to help front line workers working hard for positive social change on <a href="https://twitter.com/ctzensocialwork" alt="at Carly's Twitter" target="_blank">twitter.</a></p>

							<h3>Rapid Evaluation</h3>
							<p>Even for fully trained staff the eligibility assessment process is time consuming and prone to errors; reviewers spend a minimum of 30 minutes determining eligibility for a single application before comparing outcomes. Simple flow charts standardize the process of determining eligibility and ensure consistent and reliable evaluation regardless of the staff person involved. Requirement matrices synthesize qualifying criteria for multiple programs by identifying common information elements and presenting those elements as simply as possible to serve as a standard method of presenting impermanent program information. Visually representing complex information reduced human errors made during the decision making process and decreased total time evaluating eligibility by up to 85%.</p>
